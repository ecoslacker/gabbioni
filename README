Gabbioni

Is a computer program for design of small gabion dams.
This program helps to design small gabion dams for soil conservation purposes.
Gabbioni is not aimed to design large engineering structures.

Gabbioni uses data from a comma separated values (*.csv) text file of a
channel cross section and designs a simple gabion dam. This kind of structure
is typically designed as a set of stepped layers. The software calculate the
dimensions of each layer, the weir length (using hydrological data or high
water marks on the channel cross section) and performs a stability analysis
for the structure.

Features

Gabbioni is a Python application that is designed to be a graphical program
that helps the designer the task of design a simple structure. It uses the
GDams library, also available in this site, and other third party well known
pieces of software such as Matplotlib and PyQt4.

Requirements

- Python >= 2.7
- Matplotlib >= 1.5
- PyQt4 >= 4.11
