# Gabbioni

Gabbioni is a computer program that helps in the design of small gabion dams for soil conservation purposes. This program is aimed to help in dimensioning a gabion dam to retain sediments in a natural channel. This kind of structure is typically designed as a set of stepped layers.

## About the code

This project was created in C++ language using Qt5 libraries and QtCreator. In order to compile the code yourself the `libcsvdata` library is necessary. You can find this code at <https://github.com/ecoslacker/libcsvdata>.
